Send SMS'es from the WordPress-backend or via the programmers API.

== Description ==

GatewayAPI enables you to send SMS'es straight from the WordPress backend or via the programmers API.

All you need, is to create a free account at GatewayAPI.com, which includes €2 of credit.

If you would like to send SMS'es from the backend, the plugin provides UI's for:

**Backend:**

- Use WordPress admin to manage and send - or do it all from PHP.
- Manage and group recipients.
- Send to single recipients or groups.
- Change sender text, type of SMS - completely unbranded SMS'es.
- Dynamically use meta-data within your SMS'es.
- Track the delivery status of an SMS.
- Automatic synchronization of recipients and WordPress users, including selected metadata.
- Add unlimited meta fields to your recipients: 11 content types to pick from!

**Integration in your website:**

- Short-code generator, creating sign up, update and unsubscribe forms.
- Public forms feature CAPTCHA and two-factor flows.
- Custom security? Create a "Send SMS" form via a shortcode.

**Backed by high quality, low price EU-based SMS-gateway:**

- GatewayAPI.com has sent 180+ million SMS'es.
- We regularly send over 1.500 SMS'es per second.
- Headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark.
- Company founded in 1999.
- Free support, no subscription AND unbeatable prices.
- Most SMS'es are delivered within 0,3 second.

If you would prefer to disable the UI-features and do all the sending from code, then that's possible as well. For this purpose you can use the method `gwapi_send_sms` which accepts arguments for message, recipient(s), sender-text and type of SMS.

= New in v1.2.0: Integration with Contact Form 7 =

GatewayAPI automatically detects and extends Contact Form 7 to support public signing up, updating and unsubscribing. GatewayAPI adds a country code, mobile number and a groups selection field to the Contact Form 7 form builder.

The Contact Form 7-integration also features support fetching form field defaults based on the currently logged in users metadata, GET-variables, post meta data etc.

Furthermore, in v1.2.1, we improved with support for auto-replying to the new/updated/just unsubscribed recipient. Furthermore, a two-step validation can now be activated for the recipient signup flow.


= Getting Started =

We have created a number of short tutorials, demonstrating how to get started and use the various features. Watch the following video to see how to set everything up and send your first SMS:

= Built-in forms for sign up, update and unsubscribe =

This tutorial shows you how to create forms for the public, using the built-in UI for creating "shortcodes" (tiny pieces of code which can be pasted into any WordPress-page).

= Importing recipients from spreadsheets =

This tutorial shows you how to import recipients from any spreadsheet and into the recipients database of the GatewayAPI. It even shows how to overwrite and update the database, import extra fields from spreadsheets and how to add the recipients into groups. It works with any spreadsheet app (Excel, Numbers, LibreOffice, Google Docs - you name it!).

Video coming soon. Please see the "How to"-section for now, for more information on how to use properly use the Contact Form 7-integration.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How well does this plugin handle 10.000+'s of recipients =

Theoretically it works, but it's still in the early days for this plugin and this also much depends on your hosting providers setup. The plugin can usually easily handle 10.000 recipients at a time, but we'd recommend splitting into multiple SMS'es for now.

== Screenshots ==
1. Set up your OAuth key and secret here. This settings page is available for administrators only.
2. If the SMS Sending UI is enabled, this is how you can send a SMS from the backend.
3. Contact Form 7: GatewayAPI automatically adds extra controls for supporting signup/update/unsubscribe in the Contact Form 7 form builder.
4. Contact Form 7: Creating a "recipient groups" selection field.

== How to use ==

Either use the UI, which should be pretty self-explainatory, or use the programmers API. See the "Installation"-tab for
a quick how-to.

= Programmers API: `gwapi_send_sms` =

Send an SMS to one or multiple recipients by calling `gwapi_send_sms` with the following arguments

- $message (string) A string containing the message to be sent.
- $recipients (array|string) A single recipient or a list of recipients.
- $sender (string, *optional*) Sender text (11 chars or 15 digits)
- $destaddr (string, *optional*) Type of SMS - Can be MOBILE (regular SMS) or DISPLAY (shown immediately on phone and usually not stored, also knows as a Flash SMS)

Returns the GatewayAPI.com message-ID on success and a WP_Error on failure.

The recipients-argument may consist of either:

- An integer or string, containing an MSISDN (CC + number, digits only).
  Example number: Country code 45. Phone number: 12 34 56 78.
  Resulting MSISDN: "4512345678".
- An array containing MSISDN (see above).
- An array in which MSISDN's are keys and their values are arrays of tags.
  Example in JSON:
  { "4512345678": { "%NAME%": "John Doe", "%GENDER%": "Male" } }

*Note: SMS'es sent via `gwapi_send_sms` are NOT saved in WordPress. They are however still accessible via the traffic log on GatewayAPI.com*

= Contact Form 7 =

If you are already into Contact Form 7, the additional fields should be selfexplainatory.

**Defaults**

You can fetch defaults for the GatewayAPI fields in the same manner as is supported by most of Contact Form 7's built-in fields. Our implementation is mostly compatible with that implementation.

Enter for instance `get` to fetch from a query string variable of the same name. Enter `user_SOMEKEY` to fetch from the user fields or user meta, where `SOMEKEY` is replaced by the field name (either built-in information like email or display_name, or a meta key). Please note that some plugins, such as WP User Manager prefixes all their user meta keys. So if a WP User Manager field was labeled `phone`, the appropriate default value would be `user_wpmu_phone`.

**Verification**

Currently a two-step flow is supported for updating recipients. In this flow, the user receives an SMS before gaining access to updating his or her profile.

In the near future, this will be expanded to also support signing up and unsubscription. To use two-step flow for signup and unsubscribe, you must for now rely on the GatewayAPI built-in form generator, available in the GatewayAPI settings.
